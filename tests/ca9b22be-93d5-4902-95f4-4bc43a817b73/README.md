# Colour-Blind Trojan

<kbd>[ALERT:-](#the-url)</kbd>

This test drops a defanged Colour-Blind malware python file, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), that targets sensitive information such as credentials and personal information from the victim's computer. Colour-Blind malware was first discovered by researchers from Kroll in March 2023 and has been seen in a malicious Python Package on Python Package Index (PyPI). This test will monitor if any endpoint defense quarantines the malware.

## How

> Safety: the malware used has been defanged, so even if run, it will immediately exit.

The malware file is extracted from the test and written to a user-owned directory. The test then waits briefly before running a few checks to determine if it was responded to (not just detected) by any defensive products on the endpoint.

Example Output:
```bash
[+] Extracting file for quarantine test
[+] Pausing for 3 seconds to gauge defensive reaction
[-] Malicious file was not caught
```

## Resolution

If this test fails:

* Ensure you have an antivirus program installed and running.
* If using an EDR, make sure the antivirus capability is enabled and turned up, appropriately
